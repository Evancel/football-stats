# Football Statistics Project

In this project, you will develop a football statistics application that tracks teams, players, and match results using 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and collections as a database. You'll implement features like sorting, filtering, and 
statistical analysis to determine top teams and players. This hands-on project will enhance your Java skills, problem-solving 
abilities, and teamwork, preparing you for real-world software development.
